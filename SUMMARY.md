# Summary by GPT-4
The code changes in this commit include:

1. Adding a new entry point for the GPT CLI when using `python -m gpt` by creating a new file `src/gpt/__main__.py`. This file imports the `cli` function from `gpt_review._gpt_cli` and calls it when the script is run as the main module.

2. Moving the help text generation and help content registration from `src/gpt_review/main.py` to `src/gpt_review/__init__.py`. This change makes the help content available to other modules within the package.

3. Updating the command group definitions in `_devops.py`, `_git.py`, and `_github.py` to include an optional `is_preview=True` parameter, which indicates that these commands are still in preview mode.

4. Removing unnecessary help text generation and registration from `src/gpt_review/main.py`, as it has been moved to `__init__.py`.

Overall, these changes improve the organization of the code and make it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
## Overview
The main goal of this PR is to update the GPT CLI by marking the command groups as preview and moving the help text definitions to the `__init__.py` file.
### Suggestions
Here are some suggestions for improving the changes in this PR:

1. Add docstrings to the new functions and classes introduced in the PR, explaining their purpose and usage.

2. Consider adding comments to explain any complex or non-obvious code logic.

3. Ensure that all newly added code follows consistent formatting and style guidelines, such as PEP8 for Python.

4. Add unit tests for any new functionality or update existing tests if necessary to ensure adequate test coverage.

5. Update any relevant documentation, such as README files or user guides, to reflect the changes introduced in the PR.

6. In `src/gpt/__main__.py`, consider adding a brief comment explaining the purpose of this file and its role as an entry point for the GPT CLI when using `python -m gpt`.

7. In `src/gpt_review/__init__.py`, add a brief comment explaining the purpose of moving help text definitions from `main.py` to this file.

8. Make sure that all import statements are organized according to PEP8 guidelines, with standard library imports first, followed by third-party imports, and finally local application imports.

9. Double-check that all variable and function names are descriptive and follow established naming conventions for clarity and readability.

10. Review any changes made to existing code to ensure that they do not introduce unintended side effects or regressions in functionality.
